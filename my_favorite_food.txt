SMOOTHIE BOWL
1 heaping cup organic frozen mixed berries
1 small ripe banana (sliced and frozen)
2-3 Tbsp light coconut or almond milk (plus more as needed)
1 scoop plain or vanilla protein powder of choice* (optional)

TOPPINGS optional
1 Tbsp shredded unsweetened coconut (desiccated)
1 Tbsp chia seeds
1 Tbsp hemp seeds
Granola
Fruit

Instructions
Add frozen berries and banana to a blender and blend on low until small bits remain â€“ see photo.
Add a bit of coconut or almond milk and protein powder (optional), and blend on low again, scraping down sides as needed, until the mixture reaches a soft serve consistency (see photo).

Scoop into 1-2 serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I prefer chia seeds, hemp seeds, and coconut, but strawberries, granola, and a nut or seed butter would be great here, too!
Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the freezer for 1-2 weeks. Let thaw before enjoying.
